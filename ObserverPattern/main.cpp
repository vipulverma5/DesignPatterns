/**
Namespace defined, an important bit that protects your code from ambiguity in the long run. Here I have written a template based signalID structure that for generic side to the signal keeping in mind the future usage.

If we examine it closely, template type R is used as the argument for the callback. Templates here become a good choice because we simply cannot have too many declarations for each varying argument that signal will have to support. Variadic templates can also be used here to support unknown number of arguments by the signal.

Callback is stored in std::function, this is part of C++11 standard and acts like a function pointer.

Below is the sample class subject.

In each and every observer pattern, subject has to extend a contract mentioning what kind of service it delivers.

On the basis of kind of service it offers, it will have unique arguments related to it.

Observers will have to register themselves using signals directly. The reason I have separate functions for registration is because of the multiple signalID structure taken. In this way you have a register events corresponding to each signalID struct taken. Using these youâ€™d end up right in the queue of callbacks your functions are to be in.

This type of callback definition is suggested. The benefit of this is, much cleaner contract, no hidden switch cases or if-else conditions.

If you look closely, Observer slots are registered with the Subject in the constructor of this class.

Further, it is also not necessary that for every Subject signal there has to be a Observer slot. It is upto the Observer whether it wants to be registered with every Subject signal or not.
